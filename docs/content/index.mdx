![Shisho - Lightweight Static Code Analyzer](/images/header.png)

_Shisho_ is a lightweight static code analyzer designed for developers and security teams.

![demo](./images/shisho-demo.gif)

The key motivation of Shisho is providing a means of **Security-as-Code for Code**. It allows us to analyze and transform your source code with an intuitive DSL. Here's an example of policies for Terraform code:

```yaml
version: '1'
rules:
  - id: 'unencrypted-ebs-volume'
    language: hcl
    message: |
      There was unencrypted EBS module.
    pattern: |
      resource "aws_ebs_volume" :[NAME] {
        :[...X]
      }
    constraints:
      - target: X
        should: not-match
        pattern: |
          encrypted = true
    rewrite: |
      resource "aws_ebs_volume" :[NAME] {
        :[X]
        encrypted = true
      }
```

Another key aspect of Shisho is **speed**; it runs so fast with the help of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)! See [Comparison](/comparison) page for further information.

In additition, **Shisho runs everywhere**! You can use this tool offline so that you don't need to transfer your code anywhere. One can use Shisho inside Continuous Integration (CI) systems like GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

Just pull the official docker image and you're ready to use ðŸŽ‰

```
docker pull ghcr.io/flatt-security/shisho-cli:latest
```

See [Getting Started](/getting-started) to learn Shisho more.

## Why Shisho?

We already have `sed` or something like that. There are already several static analysis engines in the world indeed. Now you may wonder why do we need shisho now. See [Comparison](/comparison) page to see why.

## Language Support

As of 2021/08/18, Shisho supports the following languages:

- HCL (Terraform)
- Go

See [the roadmap](/roadmap) for details.

## Feedback

We'd love to hear your feedback! Feel free to ask Shisho team in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho/issues).
